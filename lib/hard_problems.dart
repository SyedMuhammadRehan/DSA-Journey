// Hard Problems Collection
// Advanced algorithms and data structures problems

// This file contains problems that are typically classified as Hard difficulty
// These problems usually require more complex algorithmic thinking and optimization

// Note: Currently no hard problems identified in the current codebase
// This file is created for future hard-level problems

// Example hard problems that could be added:
// - Median of two sorted arrays
// - Merge k sorted lists
// - Largest rectangle in histogram
// - Trapping rain water
// - Regular expression matching
// - Wildcard matching
// - Skyline problem
// - And many more...

// When adding hard problems, ensure they:
// - Have clear problem statements and examples
// - Include proper constraints
// - Have efficient solutions with explanations
// - Follow the same coding style as other files
